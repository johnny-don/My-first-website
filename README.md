# My very first website

This is the first website that I have made. It was part of my CodeInstitute full stack developer course. We created it as a way to learn the different aspects of Cloud9, Git and GitHub.

## Skills used

I created a repository on Cloud9 and built 3 html pages which were styled using css. These pages all linked to each other. I then created a git repository and used this to add, commit and push my files to GitHub.
